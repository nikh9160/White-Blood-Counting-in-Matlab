# White-Blood-Counting-in-Matlab
White blood cell counting in blood smear images using segmentation images in mathlab 

It consists of 2 files:
1. Main_Function
2. Otsu_threshold.

We need to download both and put them in the same folder and run the main_funtion in Mathlab.

Examples images are also being added in the repo.
